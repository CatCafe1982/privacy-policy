<h1>Terms of Service – QingTsaiWip V2</h1>
<p><em>Last Updated: November 12, 2025</em></p>
<p><strong>Author: 你想想</strong></p>

<p>
Thank you for using <strong>QingTsaiWip V2</strong> (“the App”).  
These Terms of Service (“the Terms”) constitute a legally binding agreement between you (“the User”) and the developer.  
By accessing or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms.
</p>

<!-- 1 -->
<h2>1. Account Registration & Authentication</h2>
<p>The App requires users to sign in before using any features.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Supports Sign in with Apple</li>
    <li>Supports Email/Password registration and login</li>
    <li>Upon login, a UserProfile is created or updated in Firestore (uid, email, displayName, createdAt, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Users may not impersonate others or share their accounts with third parties.</p>

<!-- 2 -->
<h2>2. User-Generated Content (UGC)</h2>
<p>
The App allows users to create production-related records, which may include:  
partNumber, workOrder, lotNumber, quantity, level, station, machinesString, remark, and other fields.
</p>

<p>Users are fully responsible for the legality and accuracy of all submitted content.</p>

<p>For global search functionality, the App mirrors certain data into <code>/globalRecords/</code>.</p>

<!-- 3 -->
<h2>3. Group Collaboration & Permissions</h2>

<p>Users may create groups and automatically become the group’s Owner.</p>

<p>The Owner has full administrative permissions, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Editing group information</li>
    <li>Adding or removing members</li>
    <li>Generating invitation codes</li>
    <li>Transferring ownership</li>
    <li>Permanently deleting the entire group (irreversible)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Members who join a group will have access to all group records according to the <code>visibleTo</code> access list.
</p>

<!-- 4 -->
<h2>4. Subscription (StoreKit)</h2>

<p>The App provides paid subscription features using Apple’s native StoreKit framework.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Subscription status is validated and stored in Firestore as <code>isSubscribed</code> and <code>subscriptionExpiryDate</code></li>
    <li>Certain features require an active subscription</li>
    <li>Purchasing and refund rules follow Apple’s App Store policies</li>
</ul>

<!-- 5 -->
<h2>5. Data Creation, Modification, Export & Deletion</h2>

<p>Users may freely create, edit, export, or delete their own data records.</p>

<p>Export formats include JSON, CSV, and TXT. Users are responsible for managing exported data.</p>

<p>Imported data must follow the required structure. The developer is not responsible for issues caused by malformed imports.</p>

<p>
Deleting a group (by the Owner) triggers a recursive deletion of all associated data.  
This action is permanent and cannot be undone.
</p>

<!-- 6 -->
<h2>6. User Obligations</h2>

<p>Users must not engage in any of the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Illegal usage of the App</li>

    <li>Abusing group or data creation features</li>
    <li>Attempting hacking, reverse engineering, or unauthorized system access</li>
</ul>

<!-- 7 -->
<h2>7. System Availability & Data Safety</h2>

<p>The App uses Firebase for storage and synchronization.  
While the developer aims for stable service, data loss or downtime cannot be fully guaranteed.</p>

<p>Users are encouraged to regularly back up critical data.</p>

<!-- 8 -->
<h2>8. Disclaimer of Liability</h2>

<p>The App acts as a data management tool.  
The developer is not responsible for any inaccuracies, illegal content, or misuse of submitted data.</p>

<p>
The developer is not liable for data loss caused by device failure, user error, or cloud service outages.
</p>

<!-- 9 -->
<h2>9. Changes & Termination of Service</h2>

<p>
The developer reserves the right to update, modify, or terminate the service at any time.
</p>

<p>
If the User does not agree to updated Terms, they must stop using the App.
